Hi, Iâ€™m Markus Harrer, a software engineer passionate about improving legacy systems. I analyze software data like source code, performance metrics, and version control repositories to identify underlying issues.

I love to fix weird code and remove obstacles that stand in the way of software developers. I also make the underlying issues within software systems visible to management.

I actively contribute to communities focused on Software Analytics, software architecture, software modernization, and Wardley Maps with talks, articles and other stuff that you can find here!
